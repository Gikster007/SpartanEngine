<p>Spartan Engine is one of the most advanced one-man game engines out there, it even comes with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@panos_karabelas">podcast</a>. It is built for research and experimentation, ideal for industry veterans, not individuals looking to build a game.</p>

<p>What started as a simple portfolio project helped me learn, land jobs, make friends, and grow my network. Since then, it has evolved beyond anything I imagined, now backed by a thriving Discord community with over 600 members, including seasoned professionals and a dedicated jobs channel.</p>

<p>You can benefit from this project the same way I did. That is why there are incredible <a href="https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/wiki/Perks-of-a-contributor">contribution perks</a> to help you get started, grow your skills, and build something meaningful. The most capable and ambitious young contributors will get direct support from me to reach their potential.</p>

<p>This project now serves an altruistic purpose. It exists to give back, enable others, and push the limits of what is possible.</p>

# Worlds

<img align="left" width="450" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/master/.github/images/world_selection_4.png"/>

Upon launching the engine, you'll be greeted with a selection of default worlds to load. Each world is physics-enabled, allowing you to walk around, pick objects using your mouse, and even drive a car. These worlds are designed to offer a diverse and enjoyable experience

**Forest**
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/master/.github/images/world_forest.jpg"/>
The Forest is the most advanced and demanding world. It features **33 million** procedurally generated grass blades, fully simulated and inspired by **Ghost of Tsushima**. The world spans **64.1 km²**, covered in **6,000** trees and rocks.

# Features

#### Rendering

- Cutting edge Vulkan renderer.
- 128-byte push constant buffer for lightning fast CPU to GPU data transfer.
- On the fly single dispatch GPU-based mip generation for render targets (FidelityFX SPD).
- On the fly compression and mip generation for material textures (FidelityFX Compressonator).
- Fully bindless design (materials, lights, even the samplers).
- Vulkan (main) and DirectX 12 (wip) backends with universal HLSL shaders.
- Unified deferred rendering with transparency (BSDF with same render path).
- Atmospheric scattering, real-time filtering and image-based lighting (with bent normals).
- Screen space shadows (Bend Studio's Days Gone).
- Screen space ambient occlusion (XeGTAO + visibility bitfield).
- Screen space reflections (FidelityFX SSSR).
- Fast shadow mapping for dozens of lights via a shadow map atlas.
- Variable rate shading.
- Upscaling (XeSS 2 & FSR 3).
- Dynamic resolution scaling (fed directly into the upscalers).
- Temporal anti-aliasing.
- Breadcrumbs for tracing GPU crashes on AMD (FidelityFX Breadcrumbs).
- Advanced shadow features with penumbra and colored translucency.
- Physical light units (intensity from lumens and color from kelvin).
- Frustum & occlusion (Hi-Z) culling.
- Physically based camera.
- Auto-exposure.
- Volumetric fog.
- HDR10 output.
- Tonemappers like ACES, AgX and others.
- Post-process effects like fxaa, bloom, motion-blur, depth of field, chromatic aberration etc.

###### General

- One-click project generation for easy setup.
- Universal input support, keyboard & mouse, controllers (tested a PS5 controller) and steering wheels.
- Comprehensive physics features (PhysX).
- CPU & GPU profiling.
- XML support for data handling.
- Thread pool that can consume any workload.
- Entity-component, event systems and most things you'll expect to find in a modern engine.
- Wide file format support: 10+ for fonts, 30+ for images, and 40+ for models.

# Documentation

The [wiki](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/wiki/Wiki) can answer most of your questions, here are some of it's contents:

- [Building](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/wiki/Building)
- [Contributing](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/blob/master/contributing.md)
- [Perks of a contributor](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/wiki/Perks-of-a-contributor)

#### Tutorials

While the engine is designed primarily for experienced game developers to experiment, there are resources available for those who prefer a more guided approach.

To get started, take a look at [Game.cpp](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/blob/master/source/runtime/Game/Game.cpp). This file contains all the logic for loading and setting up the default worlds within the engine, and it's a great place to understand the core structure of the engine.

# Support

I cover the costs for Dropbox hosting to ensure library and assets bandwidth is available. If you enjoy the ease of running a single script and having everything download, compile and work seamlessly, please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/PanosK92) to help keep it that way. Sponsoring directly is much more helpful than boosting the Discord server since boosts only benefit Discord, not the project. Your support goes directly into maintaining and improving everything.

# Interesting Facts & Use Cases  

- This engine started as a personal learning project and a way to enhance my portfolio while I was a university student. I also used it for my thesis at [my university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Thessaly).  
- Contributing to this project comes with great perks! Learn more about the benefits [here](https://github.com/PanosK92/SpartanEngine/wiki/Perks-of-a-contributor).  
- **Godot** integrates Spartan’s TAA. See it in action [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/37d51d2cb7f6e47bef8329887e9e1740a914dc4e/servers/rendering/renderer_rd/shaders/effects/taa_resolve.glsl#L2).  
- **Stalker Anomaly** features an addon that enhances rendering using Spartan's source. Check it out [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/screen-space-shaders).  
- Jesse Guerrero, a contributor, wrote a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXG1CMNK?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_A14WVAH86VH407JE95MG_1) on beginner programming, featuring Spartan's code, its Discord community, and leadership.  

Are you utilizing any code from Spartan Engine, or has it inspired aspects of your work? If yes, reach out to me, I'd love to showcase your project.
