## **Core Principles**  

### **Free Speech and Respect**  

We believe in the power of dialogue and exchanging ideas. Disagreeing with someone does not mean you dislike, hate, or cancel them. Say what you think, debate hard if you must, but do it constructively. Growth comes from ideas, not drama.

### **Kindness and Reason**  

Be kind, be reasonable. A strong argument does not need insults to land. Let your points speak for themselves.

### **Self-Preservation of the Discord Community**  

Free speech is vital, but if someone becomes highly toxic, attacks others, and drives members away, killing the community, we draw the line. There is no room for suicidal empathy when the server’s survival is at stake.

The person will be engaged in dialogue first. If they refuse or cannot engage constructively, they will be banned immediately. The survival of the community comes first.

## **Expected Behavior**  

1. **Engage Constructively**: Share your thoughts and opinions without hostility or malice.
2. **Be Kind**: Treat others with respect and empathy, even in strong disagreements.
3. **Stay on Topic**: Keep discussions focused on the community’s goals and purpose.
4. **Help Others**: Offer support, share insights, and build connections.

## **Unacceptable Behavior**  

To protect the community, the following behaviors will not be tolerated because they threaten the server’s survival:

- Lying, spreading false information, or misrepresenting facts.
- Personal attacks, insults, or hostility toward others.
- Refusing to engage in constructive dialogue when conflicts arise.  

These actions put the community at risk and will be addressed immediately.

## **Enforcement**  

We value dialogue first. Problematic behavior will be handled like this:

1. **Discussion**: The person will be confronted directly and honestly to resolve the issue.
2. **Ban**: If dialogue fails and the behavior continues to threaten the community, a ban will be issued immediately. Protecting the community comes first.
